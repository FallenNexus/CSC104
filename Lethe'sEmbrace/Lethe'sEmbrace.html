			<h3>ON BLACK</h3>
            <br>
			<i>We view through the main character's eyes as they open, blinking a few times before seeing a grey sky above and a forest with tall, eerie trees. The protagonist begins to panic and hyperventilates as the camera zooms out as the protagonist becomes a small spec on a huge world.</i>

			<i>NARRATOR (V.O.) (sounds like an old woman in fantasy living in a cabin in the woods)</i>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to Breostbedern, a magical world where dark magic, mystery, and fear have woven themselves into the very threads we call reality; I dare not call it a natural world when thinking of— Oh goodness, I seem to be getting ahead of myself. Now then, where was I...</p>
            <br>
            <h3>THE MAP ZOOMS IN ON THE LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS, AND EVENTS AS THEY ARE MENTIONED BY THE NARRATOR, ALL IN AN OLD MAP, WATERCOLOR STYLE.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>NARRATOR Once upon a time, there was a dark god, cruel and hated by all, known as L'appel du Vide. He was a stern ruler to put it kindly; of all the words that could be used to describe this monstrosity, friendly would be the farthest from the truth. This god ruled for millennia until one fateful night when he was pushed back into the far reaches of the land by the mortals he created with his own power, contained in a dark area no one dares go near. Hmm... what was it that mortals call it now if they even know its name.. Ah, that's right, Diegol. A rather fitting name. The victory was celebrated throughout the land.</p>
            <p>NARRATOR Not long after, mortals began to be trapped in Diegol for whatever reason, some being escapees from the city, others wishing to explore the myths of the hellish god's domain. In that short amount of time, the people knew peace like no other. sure the few random disappearances were worrisome, but they were few and far between, so their peace would not be disturbed.. yet...</p>
            <p>NARRORATOR But, as with all things, unrest crept in. Slowly, this unrest crept to such a point that the people split into two groups; one a group with extraordinary talents for both magic and technology, unconcerned by the things of a typical mortal society, such as hierarchies, wealth, sexism, and lust. The other group, filled with the common class, toiling daily in the land hoping one day to make a name for themselves. These men married and kept their egos inflamed, generation after generation, whilst the women in their society felt miserable and dreamed of running away, but their comfort was far too tempting, so they accepted their fate and became a pawn like everyone else in this new, unjust system.</p>
            <br>
            <p>NARRATOR These two groups saw an ever-growing divide, until one day the common men grew too scared of those 'mad cultists' as their first leader described them, and drove them out of their already divided city, into opposite reaches of the long-forgotten god of old. After being driven back so far, these gifted magic users cast an eternal dark mist that hid their domain, Andgiet, and made the common men forget their existence so they could practice their science in peace. Shortly after this, the commoners woke up, confused at their whereabouts, and retreated to their city, not questioning the new, black mist shrouding Andgiet. Upon their return, the first king was crowned, and their kingdom became known as the City of Leas.</p>

            <h3>EXT. GREY SKIED DARK FOREST - AFTERNOON</h3>
            <br>
            <i>WE ONCE AGAIN SEE THE FOREST FROM BEFORE, THIS TIME FROM A THRID PERSON VIEW OF THE PROTAGONIST. WE HEAR INDISCERNIBLE THOUGHTS, OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER.</i>
            <br>
            <i>ANGNES ([a 27-YEAR-OLD female, with a small, weak build, fair skin, one blue eye, one dark brown eye, dark crimson hair, and many scars all over her body, wearing a typical lower-class medieval dress].)</i>
            <br>
            <p>[frantic murmuring] Where am I? Why am I here? Wait, wasn't I.. Somewhere else? Why... Why does my stomach hurt so much? What happened? This can't be real.. [quiet, barely audible heart rate monitor beeping] Can it? What's that sound?? [beeping stops] I feel.. Like someone else. Did I...? [the indiscernible noise of her thoughts suddenly become clear for a moment, and we hear them interrupt with ...kill myself] No, I should get up. But why am I here? Surely someone must know me? Maybe I hit my head? Wait... what, no, who is that? Is that a.. Voice?</p>
            <br>
            <i>We hear a barely audible voice that sounds to be in an operating room.</i>
            <br>
            <p>ANGNES [quiet] Is... is anyone [louder] out there?</p>
            <br>
            <h3>THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT TO THE MAP ONCE MORE. THE NARRATOR SPEAKS AS THIS IS OCCURRING.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>NARRATOR [saddend] Oh my poor dear... there is someone out there waiting for you... But you're a long way off from that</p>

            <h3>EXT. FOREST - SAME TIME</h3>
            <br>
            <i>ANGNES gets up and begins walking, holding her stomach.</i>
            <br>
            <p>ANGNES I suppose I can't be trapped in here forever if I just walk straight ahead of me... right? I must have gotten in here somehow, so I should be able to get myself back out. Maybe I'll find some sort of town that can direct me hom— (ANGNES pauses) Where is my home? Why can't I remember my home??</p>
            <br>
            <i>ANGNES stops and begins to cry.</i>
            <br>
            <p>ANGNES No, now is not the time for tears, I must figure out where I am, and deal with this strange wound.</p>
            <br>
            <i>ANGNES continues walking.</i>
            <br>
            <h3>THE CAMERA FOLLOWS ANGNES, SHOWING THE DARK, MYSTERIOUS FOREST IN ITS DIM, GREY LIGHTING.</h3>

            <br>
            <h3>EXT. OPEN FIELD - SUNDOWN</h3>
            <br>
            <p>ANGNES That took longer than expected, and no sign of anyone... it's strange.</p>
            <br>
            <i>ANGNES looks around, spying a large, castle-like city in the distance.</i>
            <br>
            <p>ANGNES [confused] A... castle? Why do I feel like I don't belong here? Perhaps they will help me..?</p>
            <br>
            <i>ANGNES continues walking, still holding her stomach, heading toward the city.</i>

            <h3>I/E. CITY OF LEAS GATES - EVENING</h3>
            <br>
            <p>ANGNES Hello, I seem to have hurt myself, and have no memory, is there somewhere I can stay?</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD But of course! Guests are our highest honor here at Leas! Please, right this way, and I will take you to our king.</p>
            <br>
            <i>The GATE GAURD assists ANGNES onto a horse which he leads through the city, toward the large, eccentric castle in the middle, viewed fully after they pass through the city's third wall.</i>
            <br>
            <p>GATE GUARD Miss, may I ask where you're from?</p>
            <p>ANGNES I don't remember, all I remember is waking up in the forests yonder with pain, walking out and then I was here.</p>
            <p>GATE GAURD You must have hit your head. King Fordon XIII will make sure you are well cared for.</p>
            <p>ANGNES Thank you, sir. May I ask where I am?</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD Why you are in the great City of Leas madam! The best and only city in the world.</p>
            <p>ANGNES The... only city?</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD But of course!</p>
            <p>ANGNES But how can that be... the world... its huge, with millions upon millions of people.</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD I'm afraid not miss, save a few random misfits, the great City of Leas is all there is!</p>
            <p>ANGNES Then, what do you do all day, standing at the gates?</p>
            <p>GATE GAURD See our brave collectors of resources have proper documentation for leaving and coming. We are extremely hospitable, but we must make sure everyone here is safe.</p>
            <p>ANGNES That must be a boring job.</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD nonsense! I have the pleasure of serving our great King!</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD We have arrived at the great castle of Leas. Ah, would you look at all of her glory, such fine arcitecture, she really is a sight to behold.</p>
            <br>
            <i>GATE GUARD assists ANGNES off of the horse, ties it to a pole, and the two walk up the Castle steps.</i>
            <br>
            <h3>I/E. CASTLE OF LEAS - NIGHT</h3>
            <br>
            <i>The two walk past the many gates and guards as they walk up to KING FORDON XIII, who is sitting at his gilded throne.</i>
            <br>
            <p>GATE GUARD [bows] Your royal highness, I have found a wanderer at our gates who seeks refuge.</p>
            <p>KING FORDON XIII Hmm, yes, it seems as though you have. Fine work sir, you may go now.</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD At once sir.</p>
            <p>ANGNES Thank you for your help sir.</p>
            <p>GATE GUARD It was my pleasure miss.</p>
            <br>
            <i>GATE GUARD exits the way they entered.</i>
            <br>
            <p>KING FORDON XIII So then, tell me your story woman. Not many visitors grace our esteemed gates; what brings you to Leas on this fine evening?</p>
            <p>ANGNES [nervous] Um, I.. Woke up in the woods with no memory of how I got there, where I'm from, or where I got my injury.</p>
            <p>KING FORDON XIII What a curious predicament you have gotten yourself into. Hmm... please give me a moment to consult with one of my dukes. Please have a seat and make yourself comfortable. In the meantime, I will have one of my servants fetch you food and drink.</p>
            <p>ANGNES You really don't have to Your Majesty.</p>
            <p>KING FORDON XIII Nonsense, they live only to serve me, and if I wish they serve you, so they shall.</p>
            <br>

            <p>FEMALE SERVANT What may I fetch you, miss? We have anything your heart desires.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>WE NOW CUT TO THE SCENE THROUGH ANGNES' EYES.</h3>
            <br>
            <i>ANGNES looks with a blank stare. The ringing in her ears becomes extremely loud. She tries to respond, but her words fail her, and she collapses on the floor, hearing the muffled cries for help of the SERVANT before losing all consciousness.</i>
